## Interview Talking Points

**"Tell me about a long-term project you've completed"**
> "I conducted a 24-month self-improvement experiment where I tracked 26 different life habits simultaneously while publishing weekly blog posts documenting my progress. This required building a Jekyll website, integrating multiple APIs for automated data collection, and maintaining 100% consistency with weekly updates over 2 years. The project resulted in 160,000+ words of documentation and a replicable framework that others in the productivity community have adopted."

**"Describe a time you failed and how you recovered"**
> "In 2017, I failed spectacularly at using Beeminder for goal-tracking. Instead of giving up, I analyzed what went wrong—I lacked meta-accountability and public transparency. In 2020, I restarted with a new approach: weekly blog posts documenting everything. This transparency transformed my success rate. I went from maintaining zero goals to 26 simultaneous habits, proving that failure plus analysis equals learning."

**"How do you stay organized?"**
> "I use systems thinking and automation. For my Journal.kim project, I integrated RescueTime, GitHub, Fitbit, and IFTTT to automatically collect data, reducing manual entry. I maintained a single source of truth for all planning—no scattered notebooks. I also implemented 'meta-accountability': tracking the tracking itself through weekly blog posts. This approach let me manage 26 simultaneous projects while working full-time and attending school."
