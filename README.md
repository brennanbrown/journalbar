> "It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day, that’s the hard part. But it does get easier." —Bojack Horseman

This project is indended for me to provide weekly updates regarding my goals (systems) that I currently have on a website called [Beeminder](https://beeminder.com). Powered by Jekyll!

I’ve decided to begin this meta-accountability experiement, where I’ll report my progress with my goals on this website weekly, in collaboration with [my account](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown) on Beeminder. I hope that this extra push of consistent reporting will help me succeed with my goals and stick to good habits.
