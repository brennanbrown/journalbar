> — Week 44, Dec 30, 2020

> "The daily habits that I do which I've trained myself with using Beeminder (and that are still ongoing) have changed how I interface with my work in general."
> — Week 66, Jan 1, 2022

> "I haven't really had to use Beeminder for my schoolwork. I've just been doing my assignments and research, at a reasonable daily pace instead of trying to do everything last-minute, which used to be my default."
